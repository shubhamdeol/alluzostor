We are a small team based out of Gurugram who are passionate about building products for local businesses. We strongly believe that if we can equip the local businesses with the right tools at affordable prices, they can still flourish in a post COVID world. We want to act as a springboard for them to take their businesses to the next level and offer their customers a better experience. Hereâ€™s our founding team :
