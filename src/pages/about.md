Our goal is to democratise ordering service for its adoption in masses. It is probably the most used application of information technology. In the 21st century, we order online daily from morning to late at night, from a toothpaste to evening snack.\
\
What are we doing?\
We are efficiently integrating and automating the entire process from ordering to delivery. You can order from the store you regularly shop at. You can track live order status from Alluzo app & web

Why are we doing it? \
We want the next billion people coming online from developing countries to have an efficient and accessible system to enlist what they want to sell, and a platform to buy.

Where are we?\
Right now, we are taking our product (Alluzo) for testing in various communities. Any vendor can download our partner app and enlist products for the nearby community members to order through our user app. And we are listing for free!
