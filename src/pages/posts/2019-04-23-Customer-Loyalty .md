**About Product**- Alluzo is a one-stop ordering platform for college’s campuses.

We have created a marketplace for college community vendors, who can’t afford and maintain their own online presence, to sell online to their nearby students. For this purpose, we are developing three apps; you can find these apps in PlayStore & AppStore.

**RaseedBook App:** Vendors can sign up on Alluzo Store app, upload their products and select area on the map where they want to do doorstep delivery by their own delivery boys. It helps vendors provide a more holistic purchase experience to their regular customers.

**Alluzo Ordering App:** We have a single app on which students can order from all the nearby vendors for delivery or pickup and track their order status.

**Delivery App:** Most of the vendors have their own delivery guys. The pilot app is for their delivery guys which will allow them to manage their delivery fleet better. It helps them with order allocation, offers real-time tracking for the user and ensures timely delivery.

Long Term-

In the long term, we want to bring all neighbourhood vendors online. Just like Paytm enabled all vendor to take online payments. We want to give capabilities to all vendors in the street to start accepting online orders from their regular customer. Most of these vendors already take order on call or WhatsApp.

Hypothesis-

To test our hypothesis, we started our pilot in IIT Delhi from December 2018. We boarded all types of vendors including laundromats, restaurants(Chaayos), grocery stores, OTC pharmacies(Apollo), dairy (Mother Dairy). We have developed a pilot app to help vendors complete the delivery by themselves. Once, the vendor registers himself on the store app we provide them with posters (attached below) to promote on shop counter that now they can take online orders.

At IIT Delhi community we have 2500+ registered users in Alluzo user app and 5+ registered shop in Alluzo store app taking online orders. More than 3000+ orders placed till date. With zero marketing spend. Now, without manual oversight from us, 30+ orders are getting delivered daily.

About AEC- Alluzo Entrepreneur in Campus programme will go through 3 phases.

First (Evaluate)- Selection of Campus Entrepreneur

Interested students should form a team of 2 to 4 members, and fill the google form (Link). The idea behind this round is to gauge the contextual understanding of students about their respective college. We will choose 5 teams around India for a program period of 3 months starting from July 2019.

You can also join our WhatsApp group(Link)

Second (Launch)- OnBoarding Offline Vendors

Teams will be required to get all the shop online in and around their campus from where the student community orders. Our KPIs will be a) Acquisitions of New Vendors & Users on Alluzo Platform b) GMV per day & Growth in GMV

Teams will get a dashboard from where you can see and measure the performance of various shops which are online, near your college. You can see the health and performance of all the shops.

The third (Manage)- Improving Digital Health

We can’t guarantee a standard and systematic guidelines with calendar entries of 3 months in advance. What we can promise is a hell of a fun ride with you in charge of our App Eco-System.

We will end the process here, seeking suggestions from students to improve the digital health of these shops.

Who are we looking for?

For AEC program — We need folks, who will get vendors on board, find a workaround if there is any restriction from college administration. Someone who can look at a vendor shop and suggest hacks to improve their productivity. Throughout this journey, you will report directly to me, until I start reporting to you guys.

If you have come to an Engineering college 2–3 years back or made a decision to do MBA a year back, and now wary about it. If you incessantly dream of running your own company, do write to us. But, please write a smallish paragraph about you and plan you have for your residential campus, hidden agendas if you have any and email it to vivek@ekeekaran.com

Caution- This is tough work, hard negotiations with vendors.

No word cv or ppts pls. We have banned attachments.
